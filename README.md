**Random Forest Stock Prediction Notebook**
=============================================

**Motive**
----------

This notebook aims to build a predictive model using Random Forest to forecast stock prices. The primary objective is to evaluate the performance of the model in predicting future stock prices based on historical data.

**Dependencies**
---------------

This notebook requires the following dependencies to be installed:

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Plotly

**Overview of the Code**
------------------------

This notebook is organized into several sections:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the stock price data, including handling missing values and converting data types.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from the existing data, such as rolling averages and trend indicators.
3. **Model Training**: Training a Random Forest model on the prepared data and evaluating its performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Backtesting**: Testing the performance of the model on out-of-sample data and evaluating its ability to predict future stock prices.
5. **Visualization**: Visualizing the results of the model, including the predicted stock prices and the performance metrics.
