# Stock Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques to predict stock prices.

## Notebook 1: Random Forest

The first notebook, [RandomForest.ipynb](RandomForest.ipynb), demonstrates the use of Random Forest algorithm to predict stock prices. It includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: The notebook cleans and preprocesses the data by removing missing values and scaling the features.
2. Feature Engineering: The notebook creates new features such as rolling averages and trends to improve the model's performance.
3. Model Training: The notebook trains a Random Forest model on the preprocessed data and evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Notebook 2: SVM

The second notebook, [SVM.ipynb](SVM.ipynb), demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict stock prices. It includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: The notebook cleans and preprocesses the data by removing missing values and scaling the features.
2. Feature Engineering: The notebook creates new features such as rolling averages and trends to improve the model's performance.
3. Model Training: The notebook trains an SVM model on the preprocessed data and evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Additional Files

The repository also includes the following files:

- [Data.csv](Data.csv): The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- [RandomForest.py](RandomForest.py): The Python script used to train the Random Forest model.
- [SVM.py](SVM.py): The Python script used to train the SVM model.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the notebooks:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

## How to Run

To run the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the desired notebook (RandomForest.ipynb or SVM.ipynb) and run the cells.
